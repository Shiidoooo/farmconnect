                <p className="mb-6">
                  HarvestConnect was born from a simple observation: urban neighborhoods were full of passionate gardeners 
                  with abundant harvests, while many residents struggled to find fresh, affordable produce nearby.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Founded in 2024, we started as a small community initiative to connect these two groups. What began as 
                  a weekend farmers market in a local park has grown into a comprehensive platform that serves hundreds 
                  of families across the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, HarvestConnect is more than just a marketplaceâ€”it's a movement toward more sustainable, 
                  community-driven food systems. We're proud to support local growers while making fresh, 
                  organic produce accessible to everyone in our community.
