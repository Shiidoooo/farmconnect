# Wallet Management System - Connect & Verify Approach

## Overview
The wallet management system allows users to connect to existing e-wallet accounts by verifying ownership through account credentials (account number + PIN), rather than creating new accounts.

### Updated Features:
1. **My Wallet Section** in the profile sidebar
2. **Wallet Balance Display** showing the default wallet balance
3. **Connect E-wallet Accounts** by verifying existing accounts with PIN
4. **Cash In/Out Operations** between default wallet and connected e-wallets
5. **E-wallet Management** (connect/disconnect e-wallets)
6. **Real-time Balance Updates** across all components

### Backend API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users/wallet` - Get wallet and connected e-wallets data
- `POST /api/users/wallet/cash-in` - Transfer from e-wallet to default wallet
- `POST /api/users/wallet/cash-out` - Transfer from default wallet to e-wallet
- `POST /api/users/wallet/connect` - Connect existing e-wallet account with PIN verification
- `DELETE /api/users/wallet/disconnect/:id` - Disconnect e-wallet from user account
- `POST /api/users/wallet/create-account` - Create demo e-wallet account (admin/testing)

### Frontend Components:
- **WalletSection.tsx** - Main wallet management interface with connect/verify
- **Updated ProfileSidebar.tsx** - Includes wallet navigation
- **Updated Profile.tsx** - Routes to wallet section

## How the Connect & Verify System Works:

### 1. E-wallet Account Structure
E-wallet accounts exist independently with:
- Account Number (unique identifier)
- Account Holder Name
- E-wallet Type (GCash, PayMaya, etc.)
- PIN (4-6 digits for verification)
- Account Balance
- List of connected users
- Active status

### 2. User Connection Process
1. User enters existing account number
2. User enters PIN for verification
3. System verifies PIN matches the account
4. If valid, account is connected to user's profile
5. User can now perform cash in/out operations

### 3. Security Features
- PIN verification for account ownership
- Account active status check
- Duplicate connection prevention
- User-specific e-wallet access control

## Testing the Wallet Features:

### Setup Demo Accounts
Run the demo account creation script:
```bash
cd backend
node create-demo-ewallets.js
```

This creates these test accounts:

**GCash Account:**
- Account Number: 09123456789
- PIN: 1234
- Balance: $5000

**PayMaya Account:**
- Account Number: 09987654321
- PIN: 5678
- Balance: $3000

**BDO Account:**
- Account Number: 1234567890
- PIN: 9999
- Balance: $7500

**PayPal Account:**
- Account Number: paypal@example.com
- PIN: 4321
- Balance: $2500

**BPI Account:**
- Account Number: 0987654321
- PIN: 1111
- Balance: $4000

**UnionBank Account:**
- Account Number: 1111222333
- PIN: 2222
- Balance: $6000

### 1. Connecting E-wallets
1. Go to Profile → My Wallet
2. Click "Connect E-wallet"
3. Enter account number from above (e.g., "09123456789")
4. Enter corresponding PIN (e.g., "1234")
5. Account will be connected if credentials are valid

### 2. Cash In Operation
1. Must have connected e-wallets with balance
2. Click "Cash In"
3. Enter amount (must be ≤ e-wallet balance)
4. Select source e-wallet
5. Money transfers from e-wallet to default wallet

### 3. Cash Out Operation
1. Must have balance in default wallet
2. Click "Cash Out"
3. Enter amount (must be ≤ default wallet balance)
4. Select destination e-wallet
5. Money transfers from default wallet to e-wallet

### 4. Creating Demo Accounts
- Click "Create Demo Account" to create new test accounts
- Useful for testing without using pre-created accounts
- Created accounts can be connected by any user

### 5. Disconnecting E-wallets
- Use trash icon to disconnect e-wallet from your account
- Account remains intact, just removes the connection
- Other users can still connect to the same account

## Database Schema Updates

### EwalletModel.js
```javascript
{
  AccountNumer: String (unique),
  AccountHolderName: String,
  EwalletType: Enum,
  pin: String (4-6 digits),
  AccountBalance: Number,
  isActive: Boolean,
  connectedUsers: [ObjectId] (array of user IDs),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### UserModel.js (unchanged)
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  ewallets: [ObjectId], // references to connected e-wallets
  defaultWallet: Number
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- PIN-based verification for account access
- Account ownership validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Authentication required for all operations

### Production Recommendations:
- Hash/encrypt PINs in database
- Implement rate limiting for PIN attempts
- Add two-factor authentication for large transactions
- Use proper encryption for sensitive data
- Implement transaction logging/audit trails
- Add session management for sensitive operations

## UI/UX Features

- **Two-step Connection Process**: Account number → PIN verification
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages for all operations
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: Immediate reflection of changes
- **Dual Account Creation**: Connect existing vs. create demo accounts
- **Visual Account Type Indicators**: Emojis and clear labeling
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations

## Future Enhancements
